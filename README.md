SYNOPSIS
==================================================================
This demo App provides a way to see the Hotwire API in action. 
It is built using Intel(R) XDK that lets you create mobile apps for smartphones and tablets using
standard web languages (HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript).


WHAT DOES THIS APP DO?
==================================================================
Uses Hotwire's API to find fantastic hotel deals within the vicinity of a postal code.

GETTING STARTED
==================================================================
You will need the following to get started -

1. Intel(R) XDK. Free Download - http://xdk-software.intel.com/
2. A Hotwire API key (Register at http://developer.hotwire.com/member/register).


OBTAINING THE API KEY
==================================================================
Before you can begin using this app, you will need to get an API key 
from Hotwire at http://developer.hotwire.com/member/register. This will also 
give you a Single Sign-On Mashery ID with access to hundreds of other APIs.


SETTING UP THE API KEY IN THIS APP
==================================================================
Once you have obtained your API key, assign the API key to the 
variable api_key on line 1 of the file hotwire.js, like so -

<pre>
	var api_key ='your_api_key_here';
</pre>


ABOUT THE HOTWIRE API
==================================================================
Hotwire's APIs allows developer to access travel deals and pricing information. The APIs available are:

1. Hotel Deals
2. Hotel Shopping
3. Rental Car Shopping
4. TripStarter
5. Travel Ticker Deals

In this demo app we utilize the Hotel Deals API. In the source code
you can observe how easy it is to make an API call, parse the 
API response and return the information back to the end-user. 

Get detailed information about the Hotwire APIs at 
http://developer.hotwire.com/docs/read/Home

HOTWIRE AFFILIATE PROGRAM
=========================
Monetizing your apps built on top of the Hotwire API is possible
with the Hotwire affiliate program. When you are approved, you
modify your API calls to include your affiliate ID. Qualified
airline, hotel and rental car bookings will earn you money as
end-users find and purchase travel deals. 

You can find out more at the Hotwire develeoper portal.
